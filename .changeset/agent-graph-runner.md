Run an agent graph. A pack may now declare an `orchestrator` and an `agents` catalogue wired by `subAgents` (with hints). In `native` delegation the runner starts every reachable agent leaf first, waits for each to answer, and configures each parent with exactly its children's live addresses; an agent shared by two parents is one instance per run, external agents are referenced but never started, and everything is stopped with the run. An agent's own wrapper config is kept as it is: Krama derives a per-run copy (port, workspace, `subAgents`, prompt hints) with owner-only permissions and removes it on stop. A roster-only pack runs as a one-level graph, so existing packs behave as before. The prompt lists each agent with its description and when to use it.
